## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is a company concerned with the number of employees that will soon be reaching retirement age.  In order to plan for the upcoming "silver tsunami" of baby boomers that will be retiring from their company, they need to know how many positions will need to be filled.  Prior to this, all of their data was stored in six separate Excel files, which included the following data:

* Departments - department number and department name
* Employees - employee number, birth date, first name, last name, gender and hire date
* Salaries - employee number, salary, from_date, to_date
* Managers - department number, employee number, from_date, to_date
* Department Employees - department number, employee number, from_date, to_date
* Titles - employee number, title, from_date, to_date

As outlined above, a lot of data is available and much of it is duplicated.  In order to aggregate the data to provide concise information, it was necessary to create a database that would store joined information.  Joining the information into one database would allow specific data to be pulled to prepare for the onslaught of retirees and new positions that would be created.
